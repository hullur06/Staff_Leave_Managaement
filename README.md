# Staff_Leave_Managaement
The Staff Leave Management System is a web-based application developed using HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL, designed to simplify the management of employee leave within an organization. The system features two main portals: the Staff Portal, where employees can submit leave requests, check their leave balance, and view request history, and the Admin Portal, which allows administrators to approve or reject leave requests, monitor staff leave schedules, and generate leave usage reports. This lightweight system operates without frameworks, making it straightforward and efficient for small to medium-sized organizations to manage staff leave.
